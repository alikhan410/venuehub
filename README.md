# VenueHub
The Venuehub platform is designed as an event-based-microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for a specific aspect of the system, ensuring modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance. The key microservices include Auth Service, Venue Service, Booking Service, Job Service and Payment Service. These services communicate with each other using RabbitMQ

## Technical Design Document

## Getting Started
These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 

- [﻿Example 1](https://www.example.com/) 
- [﻿Example 2](https://www.example.com/) 
### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```
And repeat

```
until finished
```
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Sample Tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
### Style test
Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.
